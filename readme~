Sortable coding challenge, written in Python 3

clone the repo and then "python main.py <products txt file> <listings txt file>"

NOTE:
I wasn't sure if products with no listing matches should get a results object, so I chose to exclude them from the output.

the output file will be created in the output folder.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:
-filter by family if available
-some listings will get incorrectly tagged for a product if the specified product matches a substring in the title
	but there is no better match.
	(ie title = '... a30 ...' and the best product match is 'a3'. If 'a30' existed in the product list it would tag that instead)
